In Sales Performance Dashboard in Regions visualization above, it shown that the order quantity in every country is decreased every year. The sales amount also is decreased every year which can be shown in the line and area chart. In 2013, the order quantity and sales amount movement were very high but when it entered 2014, the order quantity and sales amount was very low. Thus causing a decrease in store performance and sales in various countries

### Prediction of Heart Disease Risk with Machine Learning Approach
Heart disease prediction using machine learning approach can improve the healthcare sector. The issues that are often found in the work on this project is there are still many hospital staff who are not precise in diagnosing patients with heart disease. With data analysis on the healthcare field that can better understanding and good prediction about the diagnosed of heart disease that can prevent all the problems and issues above to happen again in the future.

The implemented heart diease web application that have example for prediction results for the input data from the user which predicts that heart disease is detected. After that there is a message to be patient that contain information of some lifestyle modifications that can be useful for improving heart health and reducing the risk of heart disease. The prediction page will also display the percentage accuracy of the model used in the heart disease prediction web app. As an example according to the picture above, based on input data from the user, the heart disease prediction web app states that heart disease is detected, display the message and the accuracy score of the model used is 87 percent.
